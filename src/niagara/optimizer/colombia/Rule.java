 Rules
 =====
 A rule is defined primarily by its pattern and its substitute.
 For example, the LTOR join associative rule has these member data,
 in which L(i) stands for Leaf operator i:
 Pattern: (L(1) join L(2)) join L(3)
 Substitute: L(1) join (L(2) join L(3))

 The pattern and substitute describe how to produce new multi-expressions
 in the search space.  The production of these new multi-expressions
 is done by APPLY_perform(), in two parts: 
 First a Bindery object produces a binding of the pattern to an Expr 
 in the search space.  Then next_substitute() produces the new expression, 
 which is integrated into the search space by SSP::include().

 A rule is called an implementation rule if its substitute has a top
 physical operator, for example GET_TO_SCAN.

 Columbia and its ancestors use only rules for which the pattern has all
 logical operators, and for which the substitute has logical operators
 except perhaps at the top.

 In O_EXPR::perform(), the optimizer decides which rules to push onto
 the PTASK stack.  It uses top_match() to checks whether the top operator 
 of a rule matches the top operator of the curent expression.

 The method O_EXPR::perform() must decide the order in which rules
 are pushed onto the PTASK stack.  For this purpose it uses promise().
 A promise value of 0 or less means do not schedule this rule here.  
 Higher promise values mean schedule this rule earlier.
 By default, an implementation  rule has a promise of 2 and others
 a promise of 1.  Notice that a rule's promise is evaluated before 
 inputs of the top-most operator are expanded (searched, transformed) 
 and matched against the rule's pattern; the promise value is used 
 to decide whether or not to explore those inputs.
 promise() is used for both exploring and optimizing, though for 
 exploration it is currently irrelevant.

 When a rule is applied (in APPLY_perform), and after a binding
 is found, the method condition() is invoked to determine whether 
 the rule actually applies.  condition() has available to it the entire
 Expr matched to the rule's pattern.  For example, the rule which
 pushes a select below a join requires a condition about compatibitily
 of schemas.  This condition cannot be checked until after the binding,
 since schemas of input groups are only available from the binding.

 The check() method verifies that a rule seems internally consistent,
 i.e., that a rule's given cardinality is consistent with its given
 pattern, and that pattern and substitute satisfy other
 requirements.  These requirements are:
 - leaves are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., (arity-1)
 - all leaf numbers up to (arity-1) are used in the pattern
 - each leaf number is used exactly once in the pattern
 - the substitute uses only leaf numbers in the pattern
 - (each leaf number may appear 0, 1, 2, or more times)
 - all operators in the pattern are logical operators
 - all operators except the root in the substitute are logical
